YeaZa NFT
NFT is an abbreviation for non-fungible tokens, it is relative to fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens are also called non-fungible tokens. What are fungible tokens? For example, BTC and ETH are all fungible tokens, so they are interchangeable. That is to say, one of your ETH and one of mine are essentially the same and have the same attributes and price. Non-fungible tokens are unique, just like works of art, each is different. They cannot be replaced with each other, so they are called non-fungible tokens. Generally speaking, NFT has unique, scarce, and indivisible attributes. It cannot be divided into 0.01BTC like BTC, it exists as a whole.

At present, NFT is applied in games, artworks, domain names, collectibles, virtual assets, real assets, identities, etc. Among them, the better development is in games, art, and domain names. The game aspect is mainly reflected in the NFT of some rare equipment and props. The NFT of art is more difficult to understand, but on some platforms, more than 1 million US dollars of digital art have been successfully traded.

Presumably, everyone will more or less see art auctions such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s mentioned in the news. That is a traditional art market. From a macro perspective, the digital art NFT market may catch up with or even exceed the traditional physical art market in the future. No matter what kind of art market, authenticity is the core of value. If it is not the genuine product, even if the imitation is infinitely close, the counterfeit has no value.

Artists in the traditional physical world use signatures to show authenticity. To identify true and false, experts are required to participate, which requires huge costs. On digital art carriers like NFT, there is no such problem.

Because NFTs cannot be forged. The artwork in the physical world may be forged, but in the field of NFT, it cannot be tampered with. In this way, as long as the digital work of any artist exists in the form of NFT, it is unique, and even the creator himself cannot tamper with or copy it. It has unique scarcity.

Of course, in the end, NFT is only a carrier, and the core is the discovery of the artistic value behind it. This is the ultimate factor that determines the NFT of digital art. But don’t worry about this, because each era has its artistic creation carrier. In the long run, as the digital native generation gets closer to digital art, as artists create more digital art (NFT), The new generation will create "Sunflowers" belonging to this generation, and future art collections may shift their focus to NFT.

The investment of NFT itself is more similar to the investment of collectibles. Therefore, in terms of NFT investment, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of the specific NFT market segment to make a good investment, especially for hobbyists. One is to enter early, and the other is to understand the market for games, digital art collections, domain names, etc., and penetrate the market demand.

In addition to the NFT itself, the project that carries the NFT is also an important part of NFT investment. The project that carries the NFT has a better chance of capturing the value of the entire ecological development than the NFT itself. Of course, this also depends on the economic mechanism design of its project token.
